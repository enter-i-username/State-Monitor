# State-Monitor
The StateMonitor class can be easily plugged into your deep learning training algorithm, and serve as a hidden state (for example the training losses, validation metrics or even hidden features) monitor. It gathers the infomation within one epoch into a serializable dictionary, and send the serialized binary codes to another process/machine outside this training process through socket communication. Once these serialized scalars and tensors are hooked into some other processes and unraveled, you can independently analyze/visualize them in real time.
